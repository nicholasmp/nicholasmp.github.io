## Silly Mistakes and the Squiggly Lines that Follow.

### My First Week Embarrassment

A week into using ESLint and IntelliJ I have realized that I kept making the same silly mistake. Something I am not proud of, but willing to admit is the fact that I wasn’t manually confirming the preferences to adhere to the “coding standards” each time before opening a new project, instead I was assuming these preferences saved for each next project. Being the bundle of fun that I am, it takes quite the embarrassing experience before I learn from my mistakes, embarrassing in this context refers to how silly the mistake and how easy the fix is. Looking at the bright side at least I’ve learned this in the first week and got this embarrassment off my chest. 

### Unnecessary Red Squiggly Lines.

 With my the end of the first week I found another reason to fuel the self hatred that comes from my mistakes. The quick and easy reason is the fact that I am sloppy. Years of careless inconsistent adherence to the “coding standards” has resulted in the unnecessary red squiggly line in today’s IntelliJ WODs. Using “let” for every variable results in a red squiggly line when declaring anything only once. Forgetting a space after function calls before the bracket, after semicolons in a for loop, or spaces before and after assignment operators, all just careless unnecessary red squiggly lines. While they all are easy fixes, they can also be viewed as easy mistakes.

### Grey Squiggly Line

Being the special snowflake that I am, I’ve noticed that I don’t have the underscore library downloaded locally to IntelliJ for some reason. The result of this is found when I try using underscore functions, I get small grey squiggly line under any of these function calls, asking if I am sure the function that I am calling exists for JavaScript. Adding insult to injury is I’ll never get the beautiful green check mark in the top right because of this. Then testing this these files compile and run using the html file when opened in a browser. Fun. Upside to this “outcome” is it requires me to use the html file each time I want to test the .js file and will make sure my html file works at all instead of assuming it works. Perfect.
