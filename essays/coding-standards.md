## Silly Mistakes and the Squiggly Lines that Follow.

### My First Week Embarrassment.

A week into using ESLint and IntelliJ I have realized that I have made the same silly mistake numerious times. Something I am not proud of, but willing to admit is the fact that I wasn’t manually confirming the preferences to adhere to the “coding standards” each time before opening a new project, instead I was assuming these preferences saved for the next. Being the bundle of fun that I am, it takes quite the embarrassing experience before I learn from my mistakes, especially one that was so easy to fix. Looking at the bright side at least I’ve learned this in the first week and got this embarrassment off my chest. 

### Unnecessary Red Squiggly Lines.

At the end of the first week some of my embarrassment from mistakes had turned into frustration. The fact of the matter was  simply I'd gotten sloppy. Years of careless inconsistent adherence to the “coding standards” resulted in the unnecessary red squiggly line in my assignments. Using “let” instead of "const" for declaring a variable only once. Forgetting a space after a function just before the bracket, after semicolons in a for loop, even before and after assignment operators, all just careless unnecessary red squiggly lines. While they all are easy fixes, they can also be viewed as easy mistakes.

### Grey Squiggly Line.

Being the special snowflake that I am, I’ve noticed that I don’t have the underscore library downloaded locally to IntelliJ for some reason. The result of this is found when I try using underscore functions, I get small grey squiggly line under any of these function calls. IntelliJ asks if I am sure the function that I am calling exists for JavaScript. Adding insult to injury IntelliJ will never produce a green check mark in the top right corner because of this, confirming that everything is working as intended. The only solution is to test the javascript file using the html file, in these cases the file functions properly when opened in a browser. Fun. On the brightside, this has conditioned me to test everything before submitting the assignment which is good to get into the habit of, whether I like it or not.
