# Overview

This is an initial idea that might sound pessimistic at first. 

### The problem being with the style of Professors here at UH. 

### The solution is a simplier version of rate my professor, with less of the hate.

The Website I have in mind would categorize the Professors at UH as either a "Professor" or "Researcher" instead of rating a Professor like a restaurant on Yelp. It should come to no surprise that their are both Professors and researchers alike who work here at the Univeristy of Hawaii, but I don't think that the level of interest or effort put into their teaching should vary by so much. 

# WebSite Pages

 - Home Page(Probably include a basic logo simple navbar)
 - A sign in and out page (signing in gives students the ability to either leave constructive comments or a Researcher/Professor rating)
 - A sign up page (allowing users to sign up to leave comments or ratings)
 - Search page allowing students to search individual instructors
 - Individual Pages for each major listing the instructors, their courses, and ratings
 - Individual instructor pages listing the included fields from above and comments from other students.
 
# Use case ideas

 - Initially the website is open to be viewed by all users.
 - Logged in users are allowed to rate or comment on instructors.
 - Admins are required to filter hateful comments and ban users who consistently hate on instructors without constructive criticism.
 
# Beyond the basics

 - All information is viewable by all users
 - Logged in users are allowed to leave comments and ratings
 - Admins filter out non constructive content
