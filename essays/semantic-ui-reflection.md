## Why choose between eligible code and a beautiful interface?


Truth be told, semantic ui isn’t the best way improve the aesthetics of a website, but it does make things easier a little easier. The basics of html was very simple and quick to learn, but the visual representation of the website itself was lackluster and the code looked fairly daunting at first glance. CSS made the styling of html look a little nicer, but still yet the code was hard to read and would take a large portion of time to understand. And now, two weeks after learning html, steps in semantic ui. While it does look foreign to anyone who doesn’t understand the basics of html, the key terms when defining menus or items is quite easy to understand. That is the beauty of semantic ui, if you want something to look a certain way, all you have to do is say it, “ui borderless inverted menu” and you have a black menu with items without border. Simple, easy to read, and the outcome is nice to look at.

### A struggle or a learning experience?

The superficial idea that your opinion determines whether a situation is good or bad, while superficial, is true. Don’t get me wrong, learning semantic ui was like learning another programing language and I did struggle with it, but I don’t want to remember this as a negative experience. I want to say I learned something new from this experience that will positively affect me in my future ventures. 

### Investing in KNOWLEDGE… not a lamborghini

I don’t want to say my time spent learning semantic ui won't lead to an investment into a lamborghini, but in the near future I will leave this course with new knowledge, not a new car. I don’t personally think that I will make my living off of making websites by writing html, css, and semantic ui, but I recognize the need and demand to making functional websites that both look good to viewers and are easy to adjust later down the line. I’m not against working on and creating a few websites out of college because frankly I have enjoyed cloning websites. It should be known I haven’t done a perfect recreation of each website so far, but in a matter of three weeks i’ve gone from not even knowing how to write html to attempting to reproduce websites from major developers which look close enough for me have a larger than usual smile on my face that isn’t very humbling.
