summary: At the end of my Spring 2019 ICS 314 course my class was assigned a final project, we were asked to form groups and create a website based around an idea that helps the other students in regards to our University.

During this final project I was grouped with three other students in my class, Ronnie, Quinne, and Yusuke. We were given roughly four weeks, with weekly milestones to report on our progress. My group was tasked with creating a website that allowed students to find all the registered independent organizations at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. In layman's terms we were asked to build a site that housed all the clubs at UH. 

During the project we were also tasked with building a homepage that described the overview of our website, how to use it, and how to download our code to play around with it.

You can learn more about the overview of the project @ [MyUH Club Home Page](https://myuh-club.github.io/).

The final product of our website has a homepage and requires users to login in to view it any further. The site has three types of users, a normal user, your everyday student, an organizer, usually a club leader, and an admin, a developer or website administrator. The type and level of visual access across the site is determined by the type of user, and as such a normal user will be able to find clubs, contact developers, and report problems, organizers can edit their clubs, and admins can do all the above plus view and resolve reports. 

You can view the finished website @ [MyUH Club Website](http://myuh-club.meteorapp.com/#/).
