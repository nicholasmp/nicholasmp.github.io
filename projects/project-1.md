All students at Kapiolani Community College(KCC) enrolled in any Stem (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) classes are able to take advantage of the free tutoring service in the Stem center at KCC. The Stem center at KCC is located in the Kokiâ€˜o building room 202, the stem center also houses the offices to a few stem professors. To access the services of the Stem center students are asked to sign into a computer at the door on the left of the entrance. From there students are encouraged to locate a tutor, who all have large name cards situated to face toward the door, and introduce themselves asking a question that the tutor can help them solve. 

You can more about the KCC stem center at the [KCC Stem Center Home Page](http://stem.kapiolani.hawaii.edu/the-stem-center/). And look for the "'Imi Na'auao Peer Mentor Program" under the students tab for a full schedule of the tutors available at KCC.

For this project, I was asked to help fill in for previous tutors who left as the stem center was having issues recruiting new peer mentors. I worked as an ICS tutor during the semester of Spring 2018 tutoring students in ICS 111 and ICS 211. In that time I learned a few things when interacting with other students as a tutor, complete patience since everyone learns differently, and how to help a student without doing their work for them. The tasks and responibilities of a tutor were simple, use my knoweledge and experiences in my previous classes to help solve the problems current students have and help teach students a different way of looking at a problem to help them better understand the issue they originally had. By the end of the semester I had helped a small handfull of students, and learned how to properly outline and explain the problem presented to me without comnpleteing their assignment for them.

I would like to also highlight two major experiences I would see when interacting with students as a tutor. The first major experience as a tutor was meeting a student who had a specific problem, had gone through their own process to fixing it and now wanted a different set of eyes to work. These interactions took anywhere from 30 minutes to maybe an hour, since the student knew what they were doing the most we would contribute was patience and the occasional hint to the problem. The other major experience was meeting students with a broad problem, and usually procastinated to the last second. In these interactions the questions they would bring up were "I don't know where to start", "I don't understand", and "Could you show me how to do it?", all of which were geared toward the student to get the tutor to finish their work for them. And to be fair I fell for these tactics once, catching myself half way through helping a student, but a learning experience nonetheless. And I found that students who actually didn't understand the topic, if they understood the class and had kept up, then all they need was an outline or a walkthrough, kind of like helping someone ride a bike for the first time. But those students who neglected their class and or studies would just keep asking the same questions until either they left or the tutor caved in. All the ICS tutors learned and communicated to each other these types of behaviours early on before anyone exploited that resource in this way. Near the end of the semester we also learned that a few of the students who originally neglected their class realized we weren't there to give out free answers and instead took the class more seriously and would come in for help with more specific issues as the semester went on.
