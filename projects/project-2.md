During my Fall semester at Kapiolani Community College(KCC) I took part in a project for my ICS 211 course that required us to recreate simple code behind the popular video game Pokemon. All of my final submission files are in a GitHub repository, these include a simple pokedex, pokemon from bulbasaur to blastoise(pokemon numbers 1-9), the pokemon types, an array and arraylist structure to save lists of pokemon, a tree structure to order pokemon, an interactive game, and a very simple user interface. 

The project was split up into multiple different assignments, a couple of files of code was recreated from base code given to us by our professor. Bublasaur, charmander, and squirtle all had to be modified and changed from our professors base code and we had to apply the idea of polymorphism to connect them to their evolutions. The element Type files were all given to us, the parent Pokemon file itself, and a few lines of code that we recieved from the professor when asked for help. Besides that the rest of the files were created by the students. The class had to work on this project by themselves, but each student did review atleast one other students work after the completion of each file, so while this was a project completed individually we did have help during the review processes during class.
