As a computer science student programing is a large interest of mine, but as of recent the political debate has started to also peek my interest. During the last political election between the now elected Trump and his opponent Hillary Clinton, I quickly recognized that the political debate can be easily manipulated and that a large portion of people don’t know what they can actually rely on as credible data or not. I came to this realization when I had two different friends, supporting the two opposite candidates who would support and counter each others claims from multiple different sources. Which brings me to why I want to make a language recognition software that identifies political agendas. 

During my first semester at college I tried to balance my first experience at a higher education with also keeping up with such a large political election. I also realized that as time went on in the political election people claimed that votes were based off of political party and not on actual reasoning. I want to make this an issue, that political parties flood individuals with information and hope those who don’t follow will vote based off of the party. In my case I started to do the same, I voted off of the party based on family views. I want to start this project to make the next political election and possibly all political elections, Presidential to even state Governor elections easier to follow by using software to find credible sites with true political neutrality to read. Or possibly even videos or strict data to look at when making a political decision or claims.
